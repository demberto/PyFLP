📘 Writing the docs
===================

*This section is still a WIP.*

Guidelines
----------

1. ↔ **80 columns** max, wherever possible. Don't consider this for inlined links
   and tables.

   .. tip::

      Don't start a new sentence at the end of a line. Remember that it should
      be easily readable to you, first of all.

2. 🌐 **Inline links** if they aren't used twice in the same document.
3. 📝 Should look **clean** enough in a simple text viewer as well.
4. 💡 Use **emojis** - Visual hints are very powerul.
5. ⚫⚪ Add images for both **light** and **dark** modes.
