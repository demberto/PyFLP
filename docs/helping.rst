🙌 Helping PyFLP
=================

PyFLP is completely free and open source (FOSS) software. It takes a lot of
time and efforts to maintain it and keep improving it. I try to help anyone
having any issues or anyone who wants to contribute in any way possible to the
best of my efforts.

I don't ask for donations or any sort of funding. If you like PyFLP and want it
to grow and improve, you can do the following things:

⭐ Star **PyFLP** on Github

You can "star" the repo if you have a Github account. It is analogous to
"following" on social media and helps :abbr:`SEO (Search engine optimization)`.
